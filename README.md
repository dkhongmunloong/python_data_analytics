DATASET DETAILS: E-COMMERCE ONLINE RETAIL
▸ This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions
occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based
and registered non-store online retail.
▸ The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts.
▸ Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
▸ 45.6MB in size
▸ Taken from https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data

PART 1 - DATA EXTRACTION & MANIPULATION (30%)
This component aims to assess proficiency with Python and data
wrangling modules. Points will be awarded to the presence of the
following:
▸ Data extraction and manipulation using Pandas
▸ Use of Python tools in your code:
▸ e.g. variables, control flow, functions, data structures, classes and/or
modules

PART 2 - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (25%)
This component aims to assess proficiency with exploratory data analysis.
Projects will be assessed on the following:
▸ Summarising data (using summary statistics, .groupby() method, etc)
▸ Noticing missing values; discussion on how to treat them
▸ Making hypotheses from interrogating the data
▸ At least three hypotheses about variable (column) relationships in your data
▸ At least one relationship should involve more than two variables
▸ Understanding and using trends to validate hypotheses
▸ Using visualisations to gather insights to support or defeat hypothesis:
▸ Proficiency with suitable graphs to show insights.
▸ Proficiency with plot customisations, e.g colour, size to represent different
dimensions.


PART 3 - DATA AUGMENTATION (15%)
This section aims to assess creativity through augmenting the given
dataset with relevant external data that can be obtained through:
▸ Screening data repositories (e.g. data.gov.sg, ourworldindata.org, Kaggle)
▸ Any other legitimate sources of data
▸ Participants are free to retrieve any kind of data to support or defeat
hypotheses, as long as it is relevant. Points will be awarded for:
▸ Finding and processing relevant data, eg. timestamps are consistent
▸ Integrating external data using pandas or python file modules
▸ Carrying out analysis with visualisation and summary statistics on the
augmented dataset
▸ Include source of external data used
▸ Additional datasets and their sources should be included in submissions

PART 4 - REPORT (15%)
The report should be a write-up documenting the whole process of the
project - described in sufficient detail. It will be assessed on two
aspects:
▸ Readability of the report by a lay-person
▸ Synthesize your technical analysis for a generic audience
▸ A non-technical layperson (without Python knowledge) reading your report
should be able to follow and understand your analysis and conclusions
▸ Technical accuracy of data analysis:
▸ Analysis should be supported by evidence from data
▸ Visualisations should be labelled with suitable axes, and interpreted correctly

PART 5 - PRESENTATION (15%)
▸ Each group will be required to give a 10-15 minute presentation on their
findings, and be prepared to support their presentation with the
visualisations and statistics of the dataset.
▸ Participants should also explain how they processed and enhanced their
dataset to support their findings.
▸ You may want to consider the following in your presentation:
▸ Effectiveness of content - subject knowledge
▸ Sequencing/clarity of information - organised in a clear, logical way
▸ Originality/creativity - unique presentation of content and ideas
▸ Visual - graphics attractive and relevant to theme/content
▸ General - engagement, elocution, teamwork
